# SpaceshipGame_NN_train

Spaceship has to avoid incoming rocks and cannot crash borders.
Neural network is implemented to guide the spaceship through space.

Run [spaceship_game.py](https://github.com/mattiarido/SpaceshipGame_NN__train/blob/master/spaceship_game.py) to see a single game. In [main.py](https://github.com/mattiarido/SpaceshipGame_NN__train/blob/master/main.py) neural network is initialized and trained with [training_data.py](https://github.com/mattiarido/SpaceshipGame_NN__train/blob/master/training_data.py)
